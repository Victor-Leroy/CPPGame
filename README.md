Other features of the game that exist in the latest versions are a level editor, map packs, user-created levels, secret coins, and a great variety of icons and game modes, as well as user coins, two shops and three secret vaults in the latest versions. The game is available on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone platforms. The game was released for Steam on December 22, 2014.
