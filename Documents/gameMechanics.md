# Geometry Dash Mechanics

## Introduction

In this document we will be discussing the mechanics of our remake of the game Geometry Dash.

## Final game mechanics

### Player

The player will be able to jump and the screen will move automatically. The player will have to avoid obstacles and reach the end of the level. The player will be represented by a square looking like this:

There will be different types of obstacles that the player will have to avoid. We will only do the black box obstacle and the spikes obstacle. The black box obstacle and spike will look like this:
