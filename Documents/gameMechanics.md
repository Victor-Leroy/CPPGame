### Final Point

The game need a final point to end the level and close it.

### White Square

The player would be represented as a white square since it will not contain any designed.

### Screen Rolling

The screen will roll from left to right but it will not decomposed and composed the level when it appear in the screen, it will just roll as a band.

### Ground

A ground will be implemented as well as a gravity system like in the original game.
